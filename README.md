## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

- Identify semantic parts of the interface
- Test and build API requesting patterns using Axios
- Build Redux action creators and reducers
- Apply API patterns with Redux
- Identify parts of interface that could be isolated into separate React components
- Build reusable React components
- Apply components into appropriate interface parts
- Style the interface using SCSS preprocessor
- Refactor the code

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Redux
- Axios

### What I learned

- LeafLet Map API with React 
- Got better at using multiple API's in a single project
- Added to my knowledge of Redux state management system

### Continued development

- I'd like to advance my skills at API POST, PUT & DELETE requests

### Useful resources

- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - This helped me correcting my syntax errors.
